#ArcGIS API for JavaScript Extent Helper

* [Live Sample](http://bsnider.github.io/web-javascript/super-duper-extent-helper/index.html)

This tool is designed to help determine Web Mercator and Geographic extents for constructing new maps.

## Features

The app is developed with Dojo and jQuery and built on top of the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://developers.arcgis.com) and [Bootstrap (ver 3.x)](http://getbootstrap.com), along with [Bootstrap Map JS](https://github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js).  

* inspired by [@noashx's](http://github.com/noashx) [Extent helper sample](http://noashx.github.io/) and Esri's [Flex Extent Helper](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapps/flexviewer/extenthelper/flexviewer_extenthelper.html)

* Next steps: Continue to style the app and fix map height.

NOTE: Please submit pull requests/issues to update to this sample.  I am always looking for ways to make this sample as useful as possible.
