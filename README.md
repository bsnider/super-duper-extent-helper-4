#ArcGIS API for JavaScript Super-Duper Extent Helper 4

* [Live Sample](http://bsnider.github.io/super-duper-extent-helper-4/)

This tool is designed to help determine Web Mercator and Geographic extents for constructing new maps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.x.  Currently, the tool is only available for 3D maps.

## Features

The app is developed with Dojo and jQuery and built on top of the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.0 beta](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/), along with [Esri's Calcite Bootstrap framework](http://esri.github.io/calcite-bootstrap/).

* inspired by [@noashx's](http://github.com/noashx) [Extent helper sample](http://noashx.github.io/) and Esri's [Flex Extent Helper](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapps/flexviewer/extenthelper/flexviewer_extenthelper.html)

NOTE: Please submit pull requests/issues to update to this sample.  I am always looking for ways to make this sample as useful as possible.
